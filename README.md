This was an ERP software for a mining firm, made to help the firm manage their inventory and sales. The app allowed users to add new inventory, mark sold inventory, analyze the sales performance through a dashboard, and get pdf of sales invoice etc. There was an ability to assign permissions to different users about what they are able to do on the app.
This work involved discussing and improving the app on a feedback loop with the firmâ€™s manager.
Tech stack: Node.js(express), MongoDB, Angular, PDFKit etc.
